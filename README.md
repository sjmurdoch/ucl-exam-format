# Styling the MIT exam class to match UCL practice

This example shows how to approximate the UCL exam style using the MIT exam class.

It's not perfect, and in particular doesn't have the same cover-page formatting utilities as the CS style, but it is hopefully a helpful starting point.

The documentation for the [exam package](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/exam/examdoc.pdf) will give some useful guidance.

If you have any questions, let me know.
